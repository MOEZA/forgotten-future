Welcome to the Forgotten Future Development Team, this document will get you started.

1. You'll need a GitHub Account. Please create one at https://github.com/

2. Please provide your github account to the administrator of this project so you can gain access.

3. Clone the source repository!
[GitHub For Beginners: Don’t Get Scared, Get Started](https://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/)

4. Once you have the source repository cloned on your PC, you're all set! You can now make changes to the source files, add new source files, and *push* the changes back to Github for everyone else to see. 

### Folders

* concept/art - General concept art
* concept/character - Character-specific designs

### Themes and Setting
* The Planet - Post-cataclysmic planet, desolate except pockets of civilization and resources. There’s a huge network of deep, abandoned underground bases from a long-forgotten past, which connect the longest reaches of earth with each other through these series of tunnels. The atmosphere of the planet has low sunlight due to large, floating debris orbiting the atmosphere (worse than Cowboy Bebop), all debris over long periods of time form tiny mini-moons which float anywhere from low, riding the atmospheric conditions to high above the clouds. 

* The Moon - The face of the moon has now changed since the cataclysm.  It now resembles a giant hole, facing the planet, as if the bottom dropped onto the planet. There’s a vast debris cloud, surrounding the moon at all times, as it maintains orbit around the planet, which also causes the earth to have rings of debris as well. 

* The Underground - Humanity escaped to the “underground” after the war. They use the surface mostly for mining, and growing certain resources unobtainable deep within the earth. However, the population still has diminished greatly, as nearly all underground bases eventually tapped out of certain vital resources. Most bases had eternal power sources, and had automated security systems, however as food ran out and the  people forgot, they left and as time went on, could not remember how to re-enter.

* The Dead Zone - The Dead Zones are areas of very low atmospheric light due to a continual destruction of the environment in the path of the ancient automated war-machines, left over from the planet’s war-torn civilization. These machines are huge, energy/organic/technological masses that resemble monstrous death-machines, with animal-like bodies and actions. These death-machines live by instinct, caught in a cycle/loop which keeps them on their continual destructive path.

* Dimensional Technology - (DimTec) Makes use of “Nth Dimension Technology” to refashion material in 3 dimensions, convert between matter and energy, and transform basic elements (Alchemy).

* Electrogravitic Repulsion - Utilizing the repulsive force between negatively charged ions, anti-gravity can be achieved. 

* Rebirth Technology - The mechanism which allows the machines (and main character) to “live forever” by rebuilding themselves from “nothing” (time+resources) continuously until they are once again whole. This occurs either on a cycle, or after destruction of “self”.

* Incarnation Technology - This technology harnesses the spiritual energy of reincarnation to give birth to a conscious cybernetic organism. This becomes more possible post-cataclysm as the potential for life is reduced across the planet

* Spirare (“Breathing Machines”) - This mechanical-spiritual form of life emerged as a side-effect of Incarnation Technology. Considered an abomination of science by some, Spirare are regarded as the next cycle in natural evolution by others. 

* Spirare Humanoids - These Intelligent Spirare Cyborgs mimic humans in every way. They are very difficult to destroy, as they employ Rebirth Technology. Only a few were ever built.
